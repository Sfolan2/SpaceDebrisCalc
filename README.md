# SpaceDebrisCalculator

This project uses java GUI to make a calculator which can evaluate the "effectiveness" of a space debris removal method by taking into account 7 factors (Time to remove, Quantity, Cost, Technological Readiness, Environmental Impact, Scalability, and the type of objects it can remove). Using these factors and the percentages provided by the user it asseses the method a score out of 100.0. Also included are 9 methods researched by our team of experts which can be seen using the buttons with the method names on them.
